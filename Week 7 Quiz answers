               tot = 0
               for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] :
                   tot = tot + 1
               print(tot)

solution)      5

Question 5)    What is the iteration variable in the following Python code:

                   if the_num < smallest_so_far :
                       smallest_so_far = the_num
               print(smallest_so_far)

solution)      -1

Question 8)    What is a good statement to describe the is operator as used in the following if statement: 
               if smallest is None :
